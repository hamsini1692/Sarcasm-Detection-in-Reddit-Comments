Title: Sarcasm Detection in Reddit Comments Using Machine Learning


Introduction

This project aims to classify Reddit comments into sarcastic or genuine using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, 
Naive Bayes Classifier, and a Deep Averaging Neural Network (DAN). It explores natural language processing techniques to understand the nuances of sarcasm in text data.

Dataset Description

The dataset comprises Reddit comments labeled for sarcasm, sourced from Kaggle's datasets for natural language processing. 
It includes features essential for sarcasm detection, such as comment text and context.

Methodology

The project involves preprocessing steps like tokenization and vectorization, followed by the application of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and DAN models. 
The choice of models was driven by the need to compare traditional machine learning approaches with more advanced neural network techniques.

Results

Results detail the performance of each model, highlighting accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. 
This section compares the effectiveness of each approach in detecting sarcasm within the dataset.
